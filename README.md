# General_Knowledge_Quiz
This project is a General Knowledge quiz created using Python.

This project:

=>utilizes both relational database MySQL as well as Graphical User Interface (GUI). 

=>The GUI in the program was implemented with the help of the module tkinter.

=>This Quiz contains a series of 10 timed questions (the player gets 10 seconds for each question) with the option of directly answering the question or having a 50/50 chance in which two wrong options (out of four options) are completely removed. 

=>The questions are derived from the SQL table to Jupyter notebook by calling it as a dataframe using Pandas module.

=>At the end of the quiz, the total marks obtained by the player are displayed in a separate window generated by tkinter
